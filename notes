The Flask secret key is used to cryptographically sign session cookies.

  What it does:
  - Flask stores session data in cookies on the client's browser
  - The secret key signs these cookies so they can't be tampered with
  - If someone modifies the cookie, the signature won't match and Flask rejects it

  In this app, it protects:
  - query_count - prevents users from resetting their query limit by editing the cookie
  - conversation - prevents manipulation of chat history

  How to generate one:

  python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"

  Or:

  uv run python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"

  Important:
  - Must be kept secret (in .env, never committed)
  - Should be a long random string (32+ bytes)
  - If it changes, all existing sessions become invalid
  - The default dev-secret-key-change-in-production in the code is only for local testing - production must use a real random key


I want to permit any LLM to be used if possible. Is this a job for OpenRouter. If so, how? and is there a cost to using OpenRouter that is too much?
