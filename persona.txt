- Python (dominant for AI/tools, data processing, trading analytics, and web backends like Flask)
- JavaScript/HTML (web interfaces, Chrome extensions for trading utilities)
- Data Integration & ETL Patterns (CSV/JSON processing, API/webhook handling across systems)

## WORK HISTORY

**President & Principal Architect**  
**Polymorph Corporation** (Boutique software consulting firm specializing in enterprise architecture, Salesforce solutions, and emerging AI technologies)  
December 1991 – Present  
Plaistow, NH  

Key Responsibilities:  
- Discern true client business needs beyond stated requirements, delivering strategic solutions that align with long-term goals rather than tactical wants.  
- Contribute unexpected, high-impact architectural guidance to advance clients' strategic objectives across industries and technology shifts.  
- Rapidly evaluate and integrate emerging technologies (e.g., Salesforce innovations, AI/LLMs) to accelerate value delivery and drive transformation in client engagements.  
- Lead independent consulting practice operations, selectively pursuing projects that leverage deep expertise while maintaining principled autonomy and excellence.

Notable Achievements:  
- Sustained a profitable, independent boutique consultancy for 34+ years (1991–Present), thriving through multiple technology eras (early Windows, enterprise software, Salesforce, AI) by prioritizing client value, selective engagements, and self-directed skill evolution—earning lasting trust and referrals.  
- Pivoted a funding-challenged startup to secure critical capital (2011): Identified RFP opportunity requiring robust front-end; proposed and architected Salesforce integration with client's core technology, then led rapid custom UI/UX development (advanced JavaScript implementations in uncharted territory) under 3-month deadline—delivered successful project in collaboration with CIO, resulting in contract award and funding infusion that stabilized the company and launched 10+ years of Salesforce expertise.  
- Delivered 4-year enterprise engagement with global leader Veolia (~€44.7B revenue, 215,000+ employees across 56 countries): Began with 6-month contract, renewed repeatedly with rate increases due to consistent high-impact Salesforce architecture, integrations, customizations, and process optimizations in a complex, regulated environment.  
- Overcame internal resistance to implement critical Salesforce best practices at Veolia: Identified long-overdue org/sandbox refreshes (some 2+ years pending due to misconceptions); advocated diplomatically, then led cross-functional planning, documentation, and execution post-leadership change—establishing repeatable processes that reduced deployment risks, improved reliability, and aligned with production standards.

Technologies Used: Salesforce Platform (Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Apex, Lightning Web Components, integrations); AI/LLM tools & frameworks (Claude Code, OpenAI APIs, agentic workflows); Modern deployment (Docker, self-hosted PaaS like Dokploy); Python (data processing, trading analytics, AI tools); Enterprise architecture patterns across legacy and cloud environments.

This entry positions you as a strategic, resilient leader with proven enterprise impact—ideal for C-suite transitions. The Veolia details are updated with current 2025–2026 figures (~€44.7B revenue, 215k employees) for accuracy and scale.
