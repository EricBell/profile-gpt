## NOTABLE PROJECTS

### persona-gpt (formerly profile-gpt) – AI-Powered Interactive Persona Web App
**Context**:  
Flagship personal project (2025–2026) marking full commitment to AI/LLMs after a year of intensive experimentation. Originally built as an "Ask Eric" interactive web app for recruiters/investors to engage dynamically with my professional persona (skills, experience, philosophy) via chat or job-description upload/matching—bypassing static resumes. Vision expands to creator economy (YouTubers, influencers, podcasters): generate custom AI personas from session data, enabling authentic user chats with a "digital twin," plus contextual monetization (merchandise recommendations/analysis/store experience with Stripe integration, or seamless ad stitching based on conversation cues).

**Your Role**:  
Sole architect, developer, and visionary. Designed core system (persona definition via hot-swappable files, session management, security), built full-stack application, integrated LLM reasoning for personality-fidelity responses, and engineered extensibility (modular features for merch/ads). Currently iterating on deployment, prompt engineering, and safeguards (e.g., injection protection, rate limiting).

**Outcome**:  
Fully functional prototype (local/Docker-deployed) supporting unlimited sessions with query limits, accurate persona-driven interactions, and JD-fit scoring. Demonstrates rapid development velocity and real-world utility for personal branding/recruitment. Positions AI as a transformative tool for engagement and monetization; publicly shared on GitHub for transparency and feedback. Lays scalable foundation for creator/influencer applications.

**Technologies**:  
Python (Flask backend, Gunicorn), OpenAI Chat Completions API (gpt-4o-mini), Docker/Docker Compose, Dokploy PaaS (VPS self-hosting), JavaScript/HTML (frontend), prompt engineering, session management/logging.

### Salesforce Org/Sandbox Refresh Initiative at Veolia
**Context**:  
During 4-year enterprise consulting engagement (circa 2020–2024) with Veolia (global leader in waste/water/energy management; ~€44.7B revenue, 215,000+ employees), identified major risk: multiple Salesforce orgs/sandboxes unrefreshed for 2+ years due to internal misconceptions and resistance from a senior leader. This violated best practices (e.g., Full Copy should refresh every 29 days to prevent metadata drift, deployment errors, and technical debt) in a complex, regulated CRM environment (Sales Cloud/Service Cloud customizations, integrations).

**Your Role**:  
Took full project ownership and leadership post-resistance clearance. Handled end-to-end project management: advocated urgency, created comprehensive plan, coordinated cross-departmental stakeholders (admins, developers, operations, compliance), documented procedures, scheduled execution (minimizing disruption), oversaw refreshes, and managed post-refresh validation/hardening.

**Outcome**:  
Executed overdue refreshes successfully, realigning environments with production and eliminating accumulated risks. Established repeatable, documented processes for future cycles—enabling efficient, low-risk refreshes aligned with Salesforce recommendations. Improved operational reliability, reduced deployment failures, and supported sustained platform value. Contributed to high client trust (evidenced by repeated contract renewals and rate increases).

**Technologies**:  
Salesforce Platform (Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, sandboxes/Full Copy, metadata management); project management workflows; cross-functional coordination for integrations/user access/compliance.

### Chicklets Modular UI for High-Speed Communications Testing Device (Microcom Contract)
**Context**:  
Early 2000s contract with Microcom (communications/testing equipment firm) to design the frontend ("glass panel") user interface for a high-speed testing device. Device featured extensible architecture (plug-in boards to monitor additional communication channels: one board = one set, two = two sets, etc.), each with myriad features/functions. Challenge: Enable intuitive control/visualization on a small built-in CRT display using only physical knobs/buttons (no touchscreen/mouse).

**Your Role**:  
UI designer and architect (sole contributor for frontend concept/implementation). Invented "chicklets" interface: small, visual tile areas on screen representing each board and its active feature/data. Users cycled through features on focused chicklet (repeated button presses), shifted focus to next chicklet (another button), and adjusted via knobs/buttons. Designed for scalability/extensibility in hardware-constrained environment.

**Outcome**:  
Delivered novel, fresh solution that was innovative for the era (pre-dating common tile-based/modular UIs in embedded systems). Microcom embraced and loved the design, enabling effective user control of a complex, scalable device. Demonstrated early foresight in human-centered design for industrial/test equipment; now feels familiar (akin to modern dashboard widgets/cards) but was pioneering then.

**Technologies**:  
Embedded CRT display interface, custom UI architecture (focusable visual tiles/chicklets), physical input mapping (knobs/buttons for cycling/focus/adjustment), extensible modular design patterns.

This gives you three strong, diverse entries: current AI innovation, enterprise process leadership, and historical UI pioneering. It shows consistent pattern of solving hard problems creatively across decades.

What do you think—ready to add one or two more (e.g., a trading tool like backtester or trading-journal ecosystem, the transcript-from-audio tool, or Dokploy VPS migration)? Or tweak any of these? Or move to another resume section (e.g., Professional Summary, Leadership/Community, Education/Certifications)? Let me know!

## SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE

### Emerging Technology Strategy & Integration

Over 45+ years, I have cultivated deep expertise in rapidly embracing emerging technologies, rigorously evaluating their strategic alignment with business objectives, strengths, and constraints, and driving thoughtful adoption to deliver outsized value. This capability was forged through independent consulting at Polymorph Corporation (since 1991) and client engagements, where I repeatedly identified paradigm shifts—from pioneering early barcoding for event/trade-show tracking in the 1980s (well ahead of widespread retail adoption) to advocating Microsoft web visualization/contract platforms at Schneider Electric, steering against unsuitable multitenant Salesforce architectures at Human Care System (deferring to domain experts while focusing on high-impact decisions), and being among the earliest implementers of Salesforce DX at Education First (pushing for direct developer support to resolve blockers). I speak authoritatively to the full spectrum: opportunity identification, risk/benefit synthesis, executive advocacy (or prudent rejection), cross-functional implementation, and iterative refinement—always ensuring technology serves true business needs rather than hype, politics, or misaligned assumptions.

### Human-Centered Interface Design in Constrained & Modern Environments

Throughout my career, I have maintained a steadfast commitment to human-centered design principles, prioritizing user productivity, intuition, and well-being over developer-driven complexity that often plagues enterprise software—excessive choices, convoluted workflows, non-intuitive transitions, and unnecessary cognitive load that slow users and reduce efficiency. This philosophy was shaped by decades of observing how software (especially in enterprise and embedded systems) defaults to feature-heavy, mysterious interfaces due to the historical expense and difficulty of crafting truly simple, empathetic UIs; my early "chicklets" modular UI for Microcom's high-speed testing device exemplifies this—creating an extensible, button-driven visual system on a constrained CRT that made complex hardware control feel natural and efficient long before such approaches became common. Today, I see AI assistance dramatically lowering the barriers to excellent UX—enabling faster iteration, adaptive interfaces, and reduced complexity—though widespread adoption remains inconsistent; I continue advocating for and building toward human-first designs that empower users rather than burden them, especially as AI tools make intuitive, context-aware experiences more achievable at scale.

### AI/LLM Strategy & Agentic Development

Since 2023, I have immersed myself daily in AI and large language models, building practical agentic systems, synthesizing their strategic implications for organizations, and advocating for the paradigm shifts required in developer/user workflows as AI moves from reactive assistants to autonomous, goal-oriented agents. This expertise is grounded in hands-on development (30+ public GitHub projects, many leveraging Claude Code for agentic coding, prompt engineering, tool integration, and rapid prototyping) and forward-thinking vision—exemplified by persona-gpt, an interactive AI persona web app that enables dynamic chat interactions, job-description matching, and extensible monetization features (e.g., contextual merchandise recommendations and ad stitching) for recruiting, influencers, and creators. I speak authoritatively to the current 2026 landscape: transitioning from monolithic LLMs to orchestrated multi-agent teams, incorporating reasoning/planning/tool-use patterns, addressing production challenges (governance, safety, reliability, human-in-the-loop), and leveraging AI to reduce complexity in enterprise applications—while emphasizing practical, outcome-driven integration that aligns with true business needs rather than hype.
