- Docker (slim Python image)

## Configuration

- API credentials: `.env` file (gitignored)
- AI persona/system instructions: stored in a local file accessible to the Flask app

## Running the App

```bash
# Local development
uv venv
uv pip install -e .
uv run python app.py --mode=local

# Docker
docker build -t profile-gpt .
docker run -p 5000:5000 --env-file .env -v $(pwd)/persona.txt:/data/persona.txt profile-gpt
```

## Guiding Document

**See [Intentions.md](Intentions.md)** - This file defines the core principles that guide all development decisions for this project. The AI persona, response style, and interaction patterns described there should inform every feature and implementation choice.
